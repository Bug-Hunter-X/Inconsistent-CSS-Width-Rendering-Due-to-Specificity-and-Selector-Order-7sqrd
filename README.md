This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in CSS related to the specificity of selectors and the sometimes unpredictable behavior of different browsers when dealing with conflicting styles. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS, while `solution.css` provides a solution to ensure consistent and predictable results.  The problem arises from the interaction between class selectors and ID selectors, leading to unexpected width rendering. The README offers insights into best practices for writing maintainable and predictable CSS.
