The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon issue related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
}

#container {
  width: 100%;
}

<div class="container" id="container"></div>
```

The `#container` selector has a higher specificity than `.container`, so the `width: 100%` should override `width: 50%`. However, depending on the order of the selectors and the browser's CSS parsing engine, the final rendered width may not always be `100%`.
