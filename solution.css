To reliably ensure the `width: 100%` style is applied, use the more specific selector first or refactor the CSS for better clarity and predictability. For instance:

```css
#container {
  width: 100%;
}

#container.container {
  width: 100%; /*Redundant but ensures the highest specificity*/
}

.container {
  width: 50%;
}

<div id="container" class="container"></div>
```

Alternatively, to improve readability and reduce complexity, consider using a more structured approach by nesting selectors or using CSS preprocessors such as Sass or Less.
